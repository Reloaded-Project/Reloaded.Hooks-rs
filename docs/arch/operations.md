# Operations

!!! info "This page provides a reference for all of the various 'operations' implemented by individual JIT(s)."

!!! tip "For more information about each of the operations, see the source code ðŸ˜‰ (`enum Operation<T>`)."

## Needed for Basic Hooking Support

### JumpRelative

!!! info "Represents jumping to a relative offset from current instruction pointer."

=== "Rust"

    ```rust
    let jump_rel = JumpRelativeOperation {
        target_address: 0x200,
    };
    ```

=== "x64 (+- 2GiB)"

    ```asm
    jmp 0x200 ; Jump to address at current IP + 0x200
    ```

=== "ARM64 (+- 128MiB)"

    ```asm
    b 0x200 ; Branch to address at current IP + 0x200
    ```

=== "x86 (+- 2GiB)"

    ```asm
    jmp 0x200 ; Jump to address at current IP + 0x200
    ```

### JumpAbsolute

!!! info "Represents jumping to an absolute address stored in a register."

!!! note "JIT is free to encode this as a relative branch if it's possible."

=== "Rust"

    ```rust
    let jump_abs = JumpAbsoluteOperation {
        scratch_register: rax,
        target_address: 0x123456,
    };
    ```

=== "x64"

    ```asm
    mov rax, 0x123456 ; Move target address into rax
    jmp rax ; Jump to address in rax
    ```

=== "ARM64"

    ```asm
    MOVZ x9, #0x3456        ; Set lower bits.
    MOVK x9, #0x12, LSL #16 ; Move upper bits
    br x9                   ; Branch to location
    ```

=== "x86"

    ```asm
    mov eax, 0x123456 ; Move target address into eax
    jmp eax ; Jump to address in eax
    ```

!!! note "We prefer this approach to `absolute jump` because it is faster performance wise."

### JumpAbsoluteIndirect

!!! info "Represents jumping to an absolute address stored in a memory address."

=== "Rust"

    ```rust
    let jump_ind = JumpIndirectOperation {
        target_address: 0x123456,

    ```

=== "x64 (< 2GiB)"

    ```asm
    jmp qword [0x123456] ; Jump to address stored at 0x123456
    ```

=== "ARM64 (< 256MiB)"

    ```asm
    MOVZ x9, #0x123, LSL #16 ; Move 0x123000
    LDR  x9, [x9, #0x456]    ; Load the value from offset 0x456 into x1
    br x9                    ; Branch to location
    ```

=== "x86 (< 2GiB)"

    ```asm
    jmp dword [0x123456] ; Jump to address stored at 0x123456
    ```
